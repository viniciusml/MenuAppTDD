    Key Concepts
 - A publisher is a provider of data, when it is available and requested.
 - A subscriber is resposible for requesting data, accepting data and control the ammount of data reveived.
 - A Operator is an object that acts both as publisher and subscriber.
 - A subject is a publisher that you can use to inject values into stream, by calling its send method.
 
    Lifecycle
 1 - When the subscriber is attached to a publisher, it stars with a call to subscriber.
 2 - The publisher in turn acknowledges the subscriber, calling receive(subscription).
 3 - After the subscription has been aknowledged, the subscriber requests N values with request(_: Demand).
 4 - The publisher may then send N values with receive(_: Input). A publisher should never send more than the demand requested.
 5 - Also after the subscription has been aknowledged, the subscriber can send a cancellation with cancel().
 6 - A publisher may optionally send completion with receive(completion).
     A completion can either be a normal termination, or may be a .failure completion, optionally propagating an error type.
